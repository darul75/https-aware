Https-aware [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/https-aware.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/https-aware) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/https-aware.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/https-aware) [![Total views](https://sourcegraph.com/api/repos/github.com/darul75/https-aware/counters/views.png)](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/darul75/https-aware)
=====================

Be aware wether initial request was HTTPS or HTTP.

Why
------------

Behing Proxy, Load balancer or other tricky network infrastructure request protocol is often balanced between HTTPS/HTTP.

This module make a header check for following headers

* Front-End-Https
* X-Forwarded-Proto

In my case, a load balancer was setting 'front-end-https' to 'on'.

Default node HTTP 'request' object prototype is enhanced to get a new method : isHttps() but, you may use isHttps(req) instead.

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install https-aware
```

Usage
-------------

```javascript
var aware = require('https-aware');
var http = require('http');
// your stuff...

// express style
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {            
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('request was made with https header or not :' + req.isHttps());
}).listen(8081); 

// express style
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {            
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('request was made with https header or not :' + req.isHttps());
}).listen(8081);
```

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
